Unfortunately, to keep things simple, I had to sacrifice a little bit of cleanliness.

To install Taffy, all you need to do is either create a Taffy folder in your web root, or create a /taffy mapping;
and in it, place the /core and /bonus folders from this archive.

Everything else is for purposes of development, testing, and examples.

Enjoy!
