# Guidelines for Contributing to Taffy

Contributions of all shapes and sizes are welcome, encouraged, and greatly appreciated!

For all contributions, you'll need a [free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).

## Bug Reports / Feature Requests

Please include all of the following information in your ticket:

* CFML Platform and version (e.g. Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.2, Railo 4.0.2)
* Java version (look it up in CF Administrator, or do `java -version` at the command line)
* Taffy version (for bugs)

## Documentation

Documentation is managed [in its own repository](https://github.com/atuttle/TaffyDocs) and changes are automatically published once they are merged into the master branch.

There's no such thing as perfect documentation. It can never be thorough enough, never perfectly organized. If you find something confusing or outdated, please at least be so kind as to file a bug report for it, if you can't or won't fix it.

## Code

Starting with the development of Taffy 1.4, all new development will be done against the **master** branch. When you want to make a change and submit it for the Bleeding Edge Release (BER), do the following:

1. [Fork the project](https://github.com/atuttle/Taffy/fork_select)
1. Clone to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/Taffy.git`
1. Create a topic branch for your changes: `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`
1. Make your changes and commit them.
1. Push your changes back to your fork. `git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME`
1. Send a pull request ([help with pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests))
  * Please make sure you select **master** as the destination branch

### Tests

If at all possible, please include test cases for anything you add or change. Taffy uses [MXUnit](http://www.mxunit.org) (not included) for testing.

You can run the test suite from the command line with Apache Ant. It's the default target, so just type `ant` from the root of the project directory and it should run them for you. **Note:** Our Jenkins instance uses the Ant script to run the tests, so if you want to run them via Ant you should either setup `jenkins.local` to point to localhost in your hosts file (and virtualhosts), or change the value for `test.server` in the build.xml file.

You can also run the tests in your browser. Install MXunit to `/mxunit` and Taffy to `/taffy`, and then point your browser to: `http://localhost/taffy/tests` (this will initialize the test api), and then to `http://localhost/taffy/tests/tests/`, which will run the test suite.

Taffy uses Jenkins for continuous integration, and you can see [build status/history here](http://fusiongrokker.com:8080/job/Taffy/).
