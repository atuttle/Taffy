# Documentation

Nobody has time to keep every framework and every dependency up to date. Sometimes you want to reference the old docs! That's why Taffy tries really hard to maintain our old docs and carry them forward with us. Below is a list of all version-specific Taffy docs releases.

In 2012 I presented a comparison of REST frameworks for CFML at the cf.Objective() conference. [This is all of the source code I used to make that comparison, as well as my slides from the talk.](https://github.com/atuttle/CF-REST-Comparison#coldfusion-rest-comparison)
